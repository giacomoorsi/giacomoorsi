#### üìà Projects in data science and machine learning
- [**OpenRitardi - Italian train delays visualization**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/OpenRitardi): OpenRitardi (Italian for *OpenDelays*) is the first visualization tool of train delays in Italy. You can see the performance of each station and train, and see where the railway service can be improved. The project showcases how open data allows accountability and improves quality of service. OpenRitardi is a website published at [openritardi.it](https://www.openritardi.it).
- [**Twitter Hateful Users detection with Graph Machine Learning**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/twitter_hateful_users): graph machine learning models to detect hateful users on a Twitter graph where nodes are users and edges are retweets
- [**Robust Journey Planner using Spark and Hadoop**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/Swiss-Spark-Journey-Planner): Journey planning algorithm on Swiss railway data that is able to estimate the probability of success of a trip, analyzing terabytes of historical data on demand, using Spark and Hadoop. 
- [**Deep Learning for patent novelty identification**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/Detect-Novelty-Patent-Applications): Collaborated with the *Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization Lab (EPFL)* to design and develop a pipeline with a neural network that predicts whether a patent application will be approved by the USPTO
- [**Identifying news polarization**](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2021-project-muesli): Analysis of 180M quotations extracted from US media sources. Built a nice data story as website available [here](https://giacomoorsi.github.io/usa-news-politicization/). 
- [**Identifying Higgs bosons on CERN data**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/HiggsBosonChallenge): Code for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson) competition on identifying Higgs bosons using machine learning

#### üíª Projects in computer science 
- [**Adaptation of the DXR library to work with Mixed Reality Toolkit**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/DXR-MRTK): DXR is a library for data visualization on HoloLens which relies on Holotoolkit. I have updated the source code to make it work with the new Mixed Reality Toolkit. 
- [**MyPantry**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/MyPantryApp): iOS app for pantry management. The app lets you store what you have in your pantry and it helps you doing your shopping list. In addition, it uses a server that matches barcode with products' information. 

#### üßÆ Projects in mathematics
- [**Progressive methods for Spline interpolation and approximation**](https://github.com/giacomoorsi/ProgressiveIterationApproximation): it contains the implementation of some methods for progressive spline interpolation and approximation in MATLAB. This work was done during my **Bachelor's thesis** in *Numerical Analysis* (you can also find the `pdf` there!).
